I did a project on mini-games 
It is done by using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Routers. In this project you play four mini-games.
The mini games are Emoji Game, Rock Paper Scissors Game, Memory Matrix Game, Card-Flip Memory Game.
In this there is a Home Page from this Home Page you can navigate to the four games.
And in this games there are scores by the result of the game you can get scores for each game.
